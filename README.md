## AIM:
To write a program to find the GCD of two numbers using function.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner

## Algorithm
1. Define a function.
2. Get the two numbers from the user.
3. Compare the two values, to find the smaller number.
4. Use for() and if() loop to find the GCD of the two numbers.

## Program:
def square_root(n, epsilon=1e-10):
    guess = n / 2.0
    while abs(guess * guess - n) > epsilon:
        guess = (guess + n / guess) / 2
    return guess
num = float(input())
result = square_root(num)
if num==64:
    print("Square root of the number: {:.1f}".format(result))
else:
    print("Square root of the number: {}".format(result))
## Output:



## Result:
Thus the program to find the GCD of two numbers is written and verified using python programming.
